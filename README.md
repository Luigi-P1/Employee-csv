# Employee-csv
This project looks at how you'd import data into a database and manipulate it.

## Details 
The project will take in a csv file. The user will be given the option to sanatise the data 
(i.e. to check if all the data is present, if the data is of the right form and if there is any duplicutes of the employee).
The application will then transfer the data to a database to be stored. If the data has been Sanatised there will be two tables created one for duplicate data amd another for invalid or missing data.
##INPUT
-option to sanatise data.(note press y for sanatation and any other button to leave the data as is.)
##OUTPUT
-the number of duplicate, missing, invalid and valid data pieces.
-how long it took to add the database.
##POINTS FOR DEVELOPMENT
Given moretime I'd implement the following
-extending the duplicute data check for other points than just the ID
-Further subdivide the classes for clarity
